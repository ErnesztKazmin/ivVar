# R Package 'ivVar'
The ivVar R package performs instrumental variable (IV) estimation for structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models. The package includes functions for the first and second stages of estimation, as well as a Psi function estimator. The Psi function can be replaced with the equivalent function from the ['vars'](https://github.com/bpfaff/vars) package, enabling the analysis of structural dynamics, such as the estimation of Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) and Forecast Error Variance Decompositions (FEVDs). Replication files are also provided to allow users to replicate the results and analyses from the paper by Gertler & Karadi (2015).
