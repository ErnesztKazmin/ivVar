R Package 'ivVar'
The ivVar R package performs instrumental variable (IV) estimation for structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models. The package includes a series of functions for the first and second stages of estimation, as well as a Psi function estimator. The Psi function can be replaced with the equivalent function from the vars package, enabling the analysis of structural dynamics, such as the estimation of Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) and Forecast Error Variance Decompositions (FEVDs).
